/**
 * Fatfs implementation for STM32F4xx devices
 *
 * This library uses Chan's Fatfs implementation.
 * 
 * This library is only for communication. To work with files, you have to look at Chan's FatFs manual, link below:
 * http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html
 *
 * You can work with SPI or SDIO protocol to interface SDcard.
 *
 * For more details look at link below

 *	- Support for truncate file from beginning
 *
 * Version 1.3

 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Library works with SPI or SDIO mode. Also, when in SDIO mode, you can set to 1- or 4-bit mode.
 * By default, SDIO with 4-bit mode is used, so you will look into right column on table below.

 * SDIO Communication
 * 
 * By default, SDIO with 4-bit communication is used.
 * If you want to use SDIO 1-bit communication, set defines below in your defines.h file:
 * 
 *	//Set SDIO with 1-bit communication
 * 	#define FATFS_SDIO_4BIT		0
 * 
 * Files needed for SDIO
 * 		- tm_stm32f4_fatfs.h
 *		- tm_stm32f4_fatfs.c
 *		- fatfs/diskio.h
 *		- fatfs/diskio.c
 *		- fatfs/ff.h
 *		- fatfs/ff.c
 *		- fatfs/ffconf.h
 *		- fatfs/integer.h
 *		- fatfs/option/syscall.c
 *		- fatfs/option/unicode.c
 *		- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd_sdio.h
 *		- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd_sdio.c
 * 
 * SPI Communication
 * 
 * Or, if you want to use SPI communication, you have to add lines below in your defines.h file
 *	
 *	//Enable SPI communication, disable SDIO
 *	#define FATFS_USE_SDIO		0
 *	
 * Files, needed for SPI
 * 		- tm_stm32f4_fatfs.h
 *		- tm_stm32f4_fatfs.c
 *		- fatfs/diskio.h
 *		- fatfs/diskio.c
 *		- fatfs/ff.h
 *		- fatfs/ff.c
 *		- fatfs/ffconf.h
 *		- fatfs/integer.h
 *		- fatfs/option/syscall.c
 *		- fatfs/option/unicode.c
 *		- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd.h
 *		- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_sd.c
 * 
 * Overwriting default pinout:
 * 
 * SDIO interface pins are fixed, and can not be changed.
 * If you want to change SPI pins, you have to set this defines in your defines.h file
 * 
 *	//Set your SPI, for corresponsing pins look at TM SPI
 *	#define FATFS_SPI							SPI1
 *	#define FATFS_SPI_PINSPACK					TM_SPI_PinsPack_1
 *	
 *	//Set your CS pin for SPI
 *	#define FATFS_CS_RCC						RCC_AHB1Periph_GPIOB			
 *	#define FATFS_CS_PORT						GPIOB
 *	#define FATFS_CS_PIN						GPIO_Pin_5
 *
 * Also, library has support for Write protect and Card detect pins.
 * This two pins are by default on pins below.
 * They are the same for any communication used, and are disabled by default
 * WP and CD Pinout
 * 
 * 	NAME	STM32F4XX	DESCRIPTION
 * 	
 *	WP		PB7			Write protect pin. Pin low when write is enabled
 *	CD		PB6			Card detect pin. Pin low when card detected
 *	
 * Like I said before, these 2 pins are disabled by default. If you want to use it, you have to add 2 lines in your defines.h file
 *	
 *	//Enable Card detect pin
 *	#define FATFS_USE_DETECT_PIN				1
 *
 *	//Enable Write protect pin
 *	#define FATFS_USE_WRITEPROTECT_PIN			1
 *	
 *	Add lines below to your defines.h file only if you want to overwrite default pin settings
 *	//Default CD pin
 *	#define FATFS_USE_DETECT_PIN_RCC			RCC_AHB1Periph_GPIOB			
 *	#define FATFS_USE_DETECT_PIN_PORT			GPIOB
 *	#define FATFS_USE_DETECT_PIN_PIN			GPIO_Pin_6
 *	//Default WP pin
 *	#define FATFS_USE_WRITEPROTECT_PIN_RCC		RCC_AHB1Periph_GPIOB			
 *	#define FATFS_USE_WRITEPROTECT_PIN_PORT		GPIOB
 *	#define FATFS_USE_WRITEPROTECT_PIN_PIN		GPIO_Pin_7
 *
 * 
 * get_fattime() time function for FatFs
 * 
 * FatFs uses function for time, to set timestamp for files, when they were edited or created.
 * 
 * By default, function returns 0, but if you want to create your own function, you have to set defines in defines.h file:
 * 
 * 	//Use custom get_fattime() function
 * 	#define FATFS_CUSTOM_FATTIME	1
 *
 * And then somewhere in your project, add function like below:
 * 
 * 	//Use custom get_fattime function
 * 	//Implement RTC get time here if you need it
 * 	DWORD get_fattime (void) {
 * 		//Get your time from RTC or something like that
 * 		
 * 		return	  ((DWORD)(2014 - 1980) << 25)	// Year 2014
 * 				| ((DWORD)7 << 21)				// Month 7
 * 				| ((DWORD)10 << 16)				// Mday 10
 * 				| ((DWORD)16 << 11)				// Hour 16
 * 				| ((DWORD)0 << 5)				// Min 0
 * 				| ((DWORD)0 >> 1);				// Sec 0
 * 	}
 * 
 * 
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 	Version v1.2
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Added support for USB MSC HOST interface with FatFS library.
 * More about, how to configure USB MSC HOST to work properly, you should take a look at 
 * my library tm_stm32f4_usb_msc_host.h. There is also default pinout for USB and other stuff.
 * 
 * I will explain here, how to properly set FatFS library to work with USB.
 * 
 * Files, needed for USB communication and FatFS
 * 		- tm_stm32f4_fatfs.h
 *		- tm_stm32f4_fatfs.c
 *		- fatfs/diskio.h
 *		- fatfs/diskio.c
 *		- fatfs/ff.h
 *		- fatfs/ff.c
 *		- fatfs/ffconf.h
 *		- fatfs/integer.h
 *		- fatfs/option/syscall.c
 *		- fatfs/option/unicode.c
 *		- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_usb.h
 *		- fatfs/drivers/fatfs_usb.c
 * 
 * After you have your files included in project, open project's defines.h file and add line below:
 * 
 * //Enable USB in FatFS library
 * #define FATFS_USE_USB		1
 * 
 * This will enable USB functions to work with FatFS module.
 * Also, when you make define 2 lines above, SD card settings become inactive.
 * If you want to use SD card and USB storage at the same time for some reason, you have to enable SD card
 * functionality. Add lines below in your defines.h file:
 * 
 * 	//Enable SDIO communication for SD card
 *	#define FATFS_USE_SDIO		1
 * 
 * 	//Enable SPI communication for SD card
 *	#define FATFS_USE_SDIO		0
 *	
 * And also, you should know, that USB has 1: partition and SD card has 0: partition.
 * So when you mount SD card, you should use:
 * 
 *	//Mount SD card
 * 	f_mount(&sd_fs, "0:", 1);
 * 	
 * 	//Mount USB storage
 * 	f_mount(&usb_fs, "1:", 1);
 * 
 * This allows you to copy data from one SD card to USB and back too.
